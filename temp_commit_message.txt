feat: Implement Phase 1 & 2 UI/UX enhancements and initial Phase 3 tasks

This commit introduces significant UI/UX improvements to the Digizinc landing page
based on the defined implementation strategy.

Key changes include:

- **Hero Section:** Enhanced "growth" text animation, integrated primary CTA button.
- **Solutions Section:** Added subtle hover effects to solution cards.
- **Contact Modal:** Implemented loading state for form submission.
- **Services Section:** Introduced broader service categorization for improved navigation.
- **New Sections:** Added dedicated "Our Packages" and "How We Work" sections.
- **Navigation:** Implemented active states for navbar links based on scroll position.
- **Testimonials:** Added subtle hover effects to testimonial cards.
- **Micro-interactions:** Enhanced industry tab icons with hover effects.
- **Documentation:** Added `app-overview.md` and `implementation-strategy.md`.

Additionally, this commit includes minor branding adjustments across several files
to remove explicit "AI" mentions from descriptions and keywords, aligning with a
broader "digital marketing" focus.
