### 1. Keyword Research & Selection (Ongoing - Monthly Review)

**Goal:** Identify high-value keywords and map them to your content.

*   **Action 1.1: Brainstorm Core Keywords:**
    *   List 5-10 broad keywords related to your services (e.g., "digital marketing agency," "AI marketing," "graphic design services").
*   **Action 1.2: Utilize Keyword Research Tools:**
    *   Use tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Google Keyword Planner.
    *   For each core keyword, identify:
        *   **Search Volume:** How many people search for it monthly.
        *   **Keyword Difficulty (KD):** How hard it is to rank for.
        *   **Related Keywords:** Other terms people search for.
        *   **Long-Tail Keywords:** Phrases with 3+ words (e.g., "best AI tools for social media marketing").
*   **Action 1.3: Analyze Competitor Keywords:**
    *   Plug competitor websites into your SEO tool to see what keywords they rank for. Identify gaps and opportunities.
*   **Action 1.4: Map Keywords to Pages:**
    *   Assign a primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords to each existing and planned page on your website (homepage, service pages, blog posts, case studies). Avoid keyword cannibalization (multiple pages targeting the exact same primary keyword).

    *   **Rule:** Break up content with `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>` tags for readability and to structure sub-topics.

    *   **Rule:** Ensure content demonstrates E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).
*   **Action 2.5: Optimize Image Alt Text:**
    *   **Rule:** For every image, provide a descriptive `alt` text.
    *   **Rule:** Include keywords where relevant and natural.
    *   **Example:** `<img src="ai-marketing-dashboard.jpg" alt="AI-driven marketing analytics dashboard by DigiZinc">`
*   **Action 2.6: Internal Linking:**
    *   **Rule:** From each page, link to 2-3 other highly relevant pages on your site using descriptive anchor text (the clickable text).
    *   **Example:** "Learn more about our [AI-powered content creation services](/services/content-creation-storytelling)."
